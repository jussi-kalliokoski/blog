Built using [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Github issues](https://github.com/jussi-kalliokoski/blog/issues) for comments, as well as [Apache httpd](http://httpd.apache.org/) for some rewrite rules.

## How To Use

Just type

```sh
$ npm install
```

and serve the `public` folder via apache and you should be good to go!

If you want to run the tests (only linting for now), type
