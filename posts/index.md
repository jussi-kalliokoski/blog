    title: About Me

Hello there! I'm Jussi Kalliokoski. I first got in touch with [programming](http://programming-motherfucker.com/) more than half my age ago, and have been hooked to pretty much everything related since. I work as a consultant at Siili Solutions (previously Rovio Entertainment Ltd and Official.fm) making some pretty cool web applications.

In the little free time I have, I'm usually either with my family or friends, make some [music](/q^), do [open source](/;), try to [share my knowledge](/[]) or [build some web standards](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-midi-api). Then there's the occasional sleep and games too. Sometimes I might even combine a few of those.

I also host my [blog](/blog) here, where I write down the thoughts I remember long enough. It's mostly programming / computers related, so if you're interested in that sort of thing, do take a look.
